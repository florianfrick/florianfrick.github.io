I'm a newly graduated software developer with a M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Colorado, Boulder, where I specialized in artificial intelligence and graduated with a 3.94 GPA.
<!-- Before then, I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science  -->
<br><br>
My projects focus on solving robotics, data science, and natural language processing problems, including imitation learning for robotic manipulation, automatic sea ice mapping with semantic segmentation, and betting odds analysis.
See my <a href="https://florianfrick.github.io/portfolio/">portfolio</a> for more details.

I am passionate about building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems and am seeking opportunities to contribute to innovative teams.
