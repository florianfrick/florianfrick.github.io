This project investigates the reliability of pregame betting odds and player statistics in predicting English Premier League match outcomes.
Historical match data, betting odds, and player statistics were analyzed to evaluate the accuracy of money line betting odds, identify potential oversights,
and determine the most impactful player metrics. First, a logistic regression model using only betting odds achieved an accuracy of 57%, but failed to predict ties.
Next, a Random Forest Classifier trained on all available player statistics achieved a lower overall accuracy of 47%, but successfully predicted some ties.
To improve performance on player statistics, we identified and combined the top 5 player statistics from the Random Forest model and the top 5 statistics using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient.
This refined model achieved 48% accuracy. To further enhance the player model, new normalized statistics, such as goals per match, assists per match, shots per match,
tackles per match, and saves per match, were introduced to better capture player impact on a match to match basis.
Players with fewer than five appearances were excluded because their limited data often skewed results, as they had minimal opportunity to contribute meaningfully in matches.
After excluding those players with limited appearances and adding the new statistics, the overall accuracy increased to 51% when using all player statistics and 53% with only the top metrics.
Although the betting model outperformed player statistics in over- all accuracy, the latter successfully predicted ties, highlighting a complementary strength.
Combining betting odds and player statistics in future models could improve predictive performance.
This analysis provides actionable insights for bookmakers, bettors, and club management, and lays a foundation for further research.
