This project investigates the reliability of pregame betting odds and player statistics in predicting English Premier League match outcomes.
Historical match data, betting odds, and player statistics were analyzed to evaluate the accuracy of money line betting odds, identify potential oversights, and determine the most impactful player metrics.
<br><br>
A simple logistic regression model using the betting odds directly achieved an accuracy of 57%, but failed to predict ties.
Meanwhile, a Random Forest Classifier using just the players stats of all players in a game achieved only a slightly lower 53% accuracy.
Although the betting model slightly outperformed player statistics, the latter was better at predicted ties, and did not rely on the betting odds.
<br><br>
This suggests that one could generate reasonable betting odds themselves using just player statistics, as the two models performed similarly.
Furthermore, this analysis provides actionable insights for club management, who can investigate the most important player statistics and identify outliers.
