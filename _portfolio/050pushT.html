Developed a model that maneuvers a robot to push a T-shaped block to a target destination. Implemented an encoder-decoder transformer model with a linear action head from scratch with PyTorch.

Future work should explore a diffusion action head, as it is shown to perform better (see Diffusion Policy, Chi).<br><br>

The model achieved successful results with 58M parameters trained over 200 epochs for 48973 seconds.<br><br>

Across 100 test simulations, I averaged 78% completion, with 55 perfect runs. While using 30% fewer parameters, my
model matches the performance of Diffusion Policy which achieves 78% average score and 59 perfect runs.<br><br>

These videos demonstrate the model successfully solving the PushT problem on unseen gym environments.

This video illustrates how the model sometimes struggles to complete the task, but ultimately succeeds.

Finally, the model has room for improvement, as this example demonstrates, where the model gets "stuck" unable to complete the task.
