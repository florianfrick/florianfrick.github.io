title: "Semantic Segmentation of Arctic Sea Ice Concentration"
excerpt: "Generated maps of sea ice concentrations from satellite images of the Hudson Bay using the SegFormer transformer model. Improved
performance over previous U-Net models from 83% to 89% pixel accuracy, demonstrating the possibilities of automatic
sea ice mapping which will reduce manual labor and ensure these maps remain up-to-date for safer seafaring. <br/><br/><img src='/images/seaice.png'>"

Creating sea ice maps of the Arctic and other polar regions has remained a challenge for both research and industry;
currently this remains a manual interpretation task by experts in the field. Attempts have been made to automate this
process using neural networks like CNNs. We expanded on previous work to automate this process by utilizing a colorized
image dataset of the Hudson Bay in Canada and a SegFormer architecture to perform semantic segmentation prediction.
Our results indicate that the model performs significantly better than a former attempt: we achieved an overall accuracy
of 89% and a mean IoU of 0.50 compared to a previous result using a standard U-Net model with 83% and 0.44, respectively.
While using this method is not accurate enough to reliably implement in industry applications, it is a positive step forward 
towards automating sea ice mapping.
