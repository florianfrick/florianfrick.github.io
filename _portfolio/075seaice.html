Generated maps of sea ice concentrations from satellite images of the Hudson Bay using the SegFormer transformer model.
Improved performance over previous U-Net models from 83% to 89% pixel accuracy, demonstrating the possibilities of automatic
sea ice mapping which will reduce manual labor and ensure these maps remain up-to-date for safer seafaring.
<br><br>
Creating sea ice maps of the Arctic and other polar regions has remained a challenge for both research and industry;
currently this remains a manual interpretation task by experts in the field. Attempts have been made to automate this
process using neural networks like CNNs. We expanded on previous work to automate this process by utilizing a colorized
image dataset of the Hudson Bay in Canada and a SegFormer transformer architecture to perform semantic segmentation prediction.
<br><br>
Our model performs significantly better than the existing U-net solution, achieving an overall pixel accuracy
of 89% and a mean IoU of 0.50 compared to U-Net's 83% accuracy and 0.44 IoU.
While this model might not be accurate enough to reliably implement in industry applications, it is a positive step forward 
towards automating sea ice mapping.

This examples illustrates how closely the model's predictions of sea ice concentration match the ground truth map.
