<br><br>Roboticists have been trying to find a way to leverage the recent and monumental success of large language models and transformer architectures.
The first important step in applying these models to the field was to develop multimodal models that use both vision and language.
These VLMs allow a robot to understand its state and environment, reason about its goals, and develop instructions.
The next key component is to actually take action via robot trajectories.
There have been several significant advances in the development of VLAs, including Diffusion Policy and OpenVLA.
These methods had promising results but some important limitations as well, which has motivated and guided future work.
