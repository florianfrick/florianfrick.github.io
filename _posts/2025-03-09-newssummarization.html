Tutorial on how to build an encoder-decoder model from scratch using PyTorch to summarize news articles. Full results and tutorial available on <a href="https://medium.com/correll-lab/building-an-encoder-decoder-for-text-summarization-c66ddf23f466">Medium</a>.

<br><br>In this article, we will explore the motivation behind text summarization, why an encoder-decoder model is well suited to the problem, and learn the details of how this model works by building one from scratch in Torch.
